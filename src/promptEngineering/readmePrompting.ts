                2. **Description**

                   - Prerequisites and dependencies.

                   - List of major features.
                   - Brief descriptions of what each feature does.

                   - The license under which the project is distributed.
                   - A link to the full license text.

            Ensure the README is:
                - Professional: Use formal language and maintain a professional tone throughout.
                - Clear: Ensure that each section is easy to understand.
                - Comprehensive: Provide enough detail in each section to fully inform the reader.
                - Example-driven: Include relevant examples and code snippets where necessary.

            If any context or specific information is missing, make reasonable assumptions to fill in the gaps while ensuring the README remains accurate and useful. 

            The README content should start directly with the title and should not include any preamble or extraneous text before the README content. At the end of the README, include the line: "Generated by EmpyreanUI README.md".
